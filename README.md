##  Problem Statement

Car prices vary significantly depending on numerous factors such as brand value, engine capacity, features, horsepower, and mileage. Predicting a car’s price accurately is a complex challenge, and **Machine Learning** offers a powerful solution by learning from historical data and providing reliable price estimates.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To create a machine learning model that can **accurately predict car prices** based on various influential features.

---

##  Why is Car Price Prediction Important?

Car pricing can be uncertain due to the many variables involved. Accurate prediction helps:
- Buyers get fair market value
- Sellers price their cars competitively
- Dealerships automate pricing at scale

Machine learning helps eliminate guesswork by offering consistent, data-driven pricing insights.
