## 🧩 Problem Statement

Car prices vary significantly depending on numerous factors such as brand value, engine capacity, features, horsepower, and mileage. Predicting a car’s price accurately is a complex challenge, and **Machine Learning** offers a powerful solution by learning from historical data and providing reliable price estimates.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To create a machine learning model that can **accurately predict car prices** based on various influential features.

---

## ❓ Why is Car Price Prediction Important?

Car pricing can be uncertain due to the many variables involved. Accurate prediction helps:
- Buyers get fair market value
- Sellers price their cars competitively
- Dealerships automate pricing at scale

Machine learning helps eliminate guesswork by offering consistent, data-driven pricing insights.

- **🔍 Data Collection**  
  Sourcing a structured dataset with car features: make, model, fuel type, engine details, and price.

- **🧹 Data Preprocessing**  
  Cleaning the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

- **🧪 Feature Engineering**  
  Identifying the most influential variables that affect car pricing.

- **🏗️ Model Building**  
  Training and comparing multiple regression models:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Lasso Regression  
  - Ridge Regression  
  - Decision Tree Regression

- **📊 Model Evaluation**  
  Evaluating models using R² Score, MAE, MSE, and RMSE.

- **🚀 Deployment** *(Optional)*  
  Deploying the trained model via a simple web interface or API for real-time predictions.
